Electricity Bill Calculator âš¡ðŸ’¡
A simple electricity bill calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I did this project as an assignment. This project calculates the electricity bill based on user input for:

- kWh used during on-peak hours
- kWh used during off-peak hours
- User's province
- It provides a detailed breakdown, including:
  - On-peak usage cost
  - Off-peak usage cost
  - Total cost after adding 13% tax and applying the provincial rebate
