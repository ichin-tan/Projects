Luffy Character Card üí™‚ò†Ô∏è
This project is a tribute to my favorite character, Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è It‚Äôs a simple, single-page website designed as a character card, featuring a color palette inspired by Luffy‚Äôs iconic design. The card highlights his vibrant and adventurous personality, making it a fun and creative way to showcase the beloved pirate captain.

Features

- Single-Page Design: Focused entirely on Luffy, with a clean and minimal layout.

Improvements & Future Ideas - The project is simple but has great potential for expansion:

- Add More Characters: Create similar cards for other One Piece characters, each with their own unique themes.
- Dynamic Switching: Enable users to toggle between characters on a single page.
- Interactive Elements: Add hover effects or animations to bring the cards to life.
- Gallery View: Build a collection of cards displayed in a grid layout.
